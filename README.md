## Introduction
**SignSprinters** is a student-led initiative demonstrating how **software engineering principles** can solve real-world challenges.  

Our flagship project, the **Traffic Sign Recognition Demo (TSRS)**, merges **AI, gamification, and Agile practices** to create an interactive system that educates users on traffic signs while showcasing the value of structured software engineering.

---

## Purpose
This project aims to:  
- üö¶ Reinforce **traffic sign awareness** in a fun and interactive way.  
- üéÆ Provide a **gamified training tool** for driving learners and schools.  
- üõ†Ô∏è Demonstrate practical **Agile collaboration and software engineering discipline**.  
- ü§ñ Lay groundwork for **AI-driven transport systems** and autonomous driving research.  

---

## Scope
- **Users**: Play a racing game where traffic signs appear randomly. Correct recognition ensures smooth progress, while mistakes apply penalties or slow the vehicle.  
- **System**: Uses a stubbed ML model to recognize traffic signs, displays confidence scores, and applies game mechanics in real time.  
- **Administrators**: Monitor player performance, view logs, and retrain ML models with updated datasets.  

**Applications:**  
- Driver education programs  
- Gamified road safety awareness campaigns  
- AI research prototypes for transportation  

---

## Methodology
The project follows the **Agile Scrum framework**:  
- **Sprint Planning**: Defined development goals for each iteration.  
- **Daily Standups**: Tracked blockers and progress.  
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demonstrated working increments to mentors.  
- **Retrospectives**: Identified improvements for the next cycle.  

Security was integrated via **Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SecSDLC)**, including input validation, HTTPS enforcement, and safe data handling.
